## Bot Features

Your bot supports both **slash commands** and **prefix commands**:

### Slash Commands
- Type `/` in Discord to see all available slash commands
- Example: `/play song name`

### Prefix Commands
- Use the prefix set in `config/bot.json` (default: `!`)
- Example: `!play song name`

## Music Commands

- `/play` or `!play` - Play a song from YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.
- `/pause` or `!pause` - Pause the current song
- `/resume` or `!resume` - Resume playback
- `/skip` or `!skip` - Skip to the next song
- `/stop` or `!stop` - Stop playback and clear queue
- `/queue` or `!queue` - Show the current queue
- `/nowplaying` or `!nowplaying` - Show current song
- `/volume` or `!volume` - Adjust volume
- `/loop` or `!loop` - Loop current song or queue
- `/shuffle` or `!shuffle` - Shuffle the queue

And many more! Use `/help` or `!help` to see all commands.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot is offline
- Check Render logs for errors
- Verify your bot token is correct in environment variables
- Make sure the bot has proper permissions on Discord

### Music not playing
- Ensure ffmpeg-static is installed (should be automatic)
- Check if the bot has permission to join/speak in voice channels
- Verify the voice channel isn't full

### Commands not working
- Make sure you've invited the bot with `applications.commands` scope
- Wait a few minutes for Discord to register slash commands
- Try using the prefix commands as fallback

## Notes

- Render free tier may sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- For 24/7 uptime, consider upgrading to a paid plan
- The bot uses opusscript for audio encoding (pure JavaScript, no compilation needed)
- Slash commands are automatically registered on bot startup
